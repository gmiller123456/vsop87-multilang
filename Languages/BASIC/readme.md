These are written to be in the syntax of Commodore 64 BASIC, but tested with Vintage Basic because they
are obviously too large to run on a C64.

The _full versions contain the test cases.  Some of the test cases appear to fail with a very large
error, but they are really just multiples of 2pi radians.  Actual errors will depend on the version
of BASIC and the floating point precision it uses.
