The purpose of this is to show how to compute the positions using an external, which may be useful for applications where it is unnecessary or incapable of storing
all of the data in memory.  This implementation is horribly inefficient, it reads the entire file for each property (e.g. x, y, and z) of each planet.  Many optimizations
are possible, but would make the code much more difficult to follow.  If you plan to use this method, and need reasonable compute times, I would recommend creating
a list of indexes into the file for each variable, so that you can "seek()" directly to the data you need, then exit the loop when the planet changes.
