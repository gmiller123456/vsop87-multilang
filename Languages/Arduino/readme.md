Use the C version of VSOP87 for Arduino, I have not duplicated all of the files here.  To use it, create a new project, then click "New Tab".
Copy and paste the contents of the version of VSOP you want to use into the new tab and you're done.

I don't have any devices capable of running the full VSOP87, so I've tested against the "small" VSOP87a version only.  It passes all tests
to an accuracy of .000009au.
