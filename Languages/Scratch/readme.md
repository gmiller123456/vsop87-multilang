I do not have a VSOP87 implementation in Scratch, but I do have code to compute the position
of the planets and stars in a basic planetarium program.  It also covers converting the coordinates
to alt/az for any location on Earth.  The positions of the planets are computed using a more compact
ephemeris (https://www.celestialprogramming.com/planets_with_keplers_equation.html) using Kelperian
Elements.
